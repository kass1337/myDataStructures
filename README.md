# My Data Structures
This repository contains my implementations of some of the data structures, including those covered in the course on algorithms and data structures at the university.

**Stack**

A data structure that works on the LIFO (last in - first out) principle. Built with a templated class. The operations of insert O (1), delete O (1), access O (1) are defined.

**Queue**

A data structure that works on the FIFO (first in - first out) principle. Built with a templated class. The operations of insert O (1), delete O (1), access O (1) are defined.

**Binary Search Tree**

A binary tree for which the requirements are met: both subtrees are binary search trees, the values ​​of the keys in the left subtree are less than those in the node, the values ​​in the right subtree are less than or equal to the value in the node.
This is a recursive version of the binary search tree.
The operations of insert, delete, search, access are defined (All O (log (n)) at best, O (n) at worst).
There are two versions of iterators: forward and backward.
